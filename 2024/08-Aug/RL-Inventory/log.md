- Copy/pasted the Qleanring code from chatgpt to the RL-Inventory repo. However, I need to figure out how to define reward in Rl case, then go forward with the implementation.

- Working on the train function, and see why it stops at specif situation and breaks. MaybeI shoudl remove that break and see what happens. So directly start from number of episodes...

- The final policy seems correct with the book. Now I need to work on how I can visuluze teh rweard plot to see what episodes I can stop the process. When is the best time to stop the process.

- No meaninful results yet. I need to work on the reward plot, it should be improving try by changing learning rate, maybe it should be adaptive, or very low value. I will try to change the learning rate and see what happens.

## 2024-08-21

- The code seems working. Now I need to think about comparing teh optimum policy versus the simple policy. I need to think about how I can compare the two policies. I will try to implement the simple policy and see what happens.
